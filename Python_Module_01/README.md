# CodeCultivation — Object-Oriented Garden Systems

## Description

The project is divided into multiple exercises (`ex0` to `ex6`), each building on the previous one. By the end of the project, a complete garden management and analytics system is implemented, demonstrating how multiple interacting components can be organized in a clean, scalable architecture.

The main goals of this project are:

* To understand how Python programs are structured and executed
* To learn and apply Object-Oriented Programming principles
* To design reusable, maintainable, and well-organized code
* To respect coding standards and best practices (flake8)

## Instructions

### Requirements

* Python **3.10** or newer
* `flake8` (recommended for linting)

### Repository Structure

```
.
├── ex0/ft_garden_intro.py
├── ex1/ft_garden_data.py
├── ex2/ft_plant_growth.py
├── ex3/ft_plant_factory.py
├── ex4/ft_garden_security.py
├── ex5/ft_plant_types.py
└── ex6/ft_garden_analytics.py
```

Each exercise is located in its own directory and contains **exactly one Python file**, as required by the subject.

### Running the Programs

Navigate to the desired exercise directory and run the corresponding file:

```bash
cd ex6
python3 ft_garden_analytics.py
```

You may replace `ex6` and the filename with any other exercise you want to run.

### Code Style

All code respects the **flake8** linter standards:

* Proper naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, snake_case for variables and functions)
* Line length limits
* Clear docstrings and readable structure
