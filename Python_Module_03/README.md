# Data Quest – Python Analytics Exercises

## Description

This project is a collection of Python exercises designed to practice
core Python concepts through a unified **data analytics and game-style theme**.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate:
- correct usage of Python basics (variables, loops, conditions)
- data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- functions and generators
- error handling
- clean code structure that follows `flake8` standards

Each exercise focuses on a specific concept while building small,
self-contained analytics systems such as score processing, inventories,
event streams, and dashboards.

The project is organized into exercises `ex0` to `ex6`,
each containing a single executable Python file.
